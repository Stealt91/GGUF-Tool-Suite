## ‚ö†Ô∏è Compatibility Notice

Support for the GLM-4.5 family was recently merged into both [**llama.cpp**](https://github.com/ggml-org/llama.cpp) and [**ik_llama.cpp**](https://github.com/ikawrakow/ik_llama.cpp), so you must update to their latest versions before using any GGUF files from this repo. Older GGUF files and older versions of either codebase will be incompatible.

- [**llama.cpp**](https://github.com/ggml-org/llama.cpp) ‚Äî see merged PR [ggml-org/llama.cpp#14939](https://github.com/ggml-org/llama.cpp/pull/14939)  
- [**ik_llama.cpp**](https://github.com/ikawrakow/ik_llama.cpp) ‚Äî see merged PR [ikawrakow/ik_llama.cpp#668](https://github.com/ikawrakow/ik_llama.cpp/pull/668)

# GLM-4.5

## ü§î What is this [HuggingFace repository](https://huggingface.co/Thireus/GLM-4.5-THIREUS-BF16-SPECIAL_SPLIT/) about?

This repository provides **GGUF-quantized tensors** for the GLM-4.5 model (official repo: https://huggingface.co/zai-org/GLM-4.5). These GGUF shards are designed to be used with **Thireus‚Äô GGUF Tool Suite** (https://gguf.thireus.com), a collection of tools that automatically finds the perplexity-optimal mix of quantizations for any given VRAM and RAM target. With the Tool Suite, you can generate and download custom quantization ‚Äúrecipes‚Äù effortlessly.

## ‚ùì Why does this Tool Suite exist?

1. **Compatibility & Speed** ‚Äì [unsloth](https://huggingface.co/unsloth)‚Äôs dynamic quants may not always work optimally with `ik_llama.cpp`.  
2. **Custom Rig Fit** ‚Äì No off-the-shelf GGUF model perfectly matched my VRAM/RAM setup, so I built a way to tailor models and leverage extra VRAM/RAM to reduce perplexity.  
3. **Automated PPL-Optimal Quantization** ‚Äì To my knowledge, there was no open source flexible, automated method to minimize perplexity for any bits-per-weight (bpw) target‚Äîso I created one with excellent results!  

---

## üìä How does it compare to other GGUFs?

Here‚Äôs how GLM-4.5 quantized with **Thireus‚Äô GGUF Tool Suite** stacks up against other quantizers (lower perplexity = better at equal or lower bpw):

![PPLs Compared With Others](https://github.com/Thireus/GGUF-Tool-Suite/blob/main/ppl_graphs/GLM-4.5.svg)

> _Note: The `recipe_examples` files illustrate good recipes. The Tool Suite computes the optimal ppl/bpw curve for you ‚Äî just specify your target RAM, VRAM, and quant types, and `quant_assign.py` finds the best mix._  

More perplexity/bpw graphs for other supported models: https://github.com/Thireus/GGUF-Tool-Suite/tree/main/ppl_graphs  

---

## üöÄ How do I get started?

Check out the [GGUF Tool Suite README](https://github.com/Thireus/GGUF-Tool-Suite) ‚Äî focus on these sections:

1. ‚ö†Ô∏è **Requirements** ‚Äì Which `ik_llama.cpp` (or `llama.cpp`) version to use and how to compile.  
   - Windows binaries (no patching needed) at: https://github.com/Thireus/ik_llama.cpp/releases  
2. üì• **Download Model Shards** ‚Äì Use `quant_downloader.sh` to fetch GGUF shards from any recipe.  
   - Recipe examples: https://github.com/Thireus/GGUF-Tool-Suite/tree/main/recipe_examples  
3. üß† **Run a Downloaded Model** ‚Äì Sample usage with `llama-cli`.  
4. üõ†Ô∏è **Generate a Custom Recipe** ‚Äì Produce recipes tailored to your VRAM/RAM target usage for optimum perplexity.  

---

## ‚úÖ Supported Models

Supported models are listed under `models/` in the [Tool Suite Github repo](https://github.com/Thireus/GGUF-Tool-Suite/tree/main/models). Presence of `ppl_results.csv` indicates official support and compatibility with `quant_assign.py`.

---

## ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Will I release baked dynamic quant GGUFs?

No, because I believe in **tailored quantization** for each user‚Äôs hardware. If you prefer ready-made shards, you are welcome to merge them via `llama-gguf-split --merge`, or request someone to publish them, or rely on generic GGUF dynamic quants such as [unsloth](https://huggingface.co/unsloth)'s.

Instead, I prefer to share examples of recipes so users can see exactly how they were produced (command included inside these recipe files) and tweak them for their own rigs. The `quant_downloader.sh` script handles automatic fetching and verification of each shard. Note that recipes provided by [Ubergarm](https://huggingface.co/ubergarm) on his model cards are also compatible with `quant_downloader.sh`.

Users who don‚Äôt trust the GGUF shards on HuggingFace can also quantize their own by passing recipe lines to `llama-quantize --custom-q` ([see example](https://github.com/Thireus/GGUF-Tool-Suite/blob/main/models/DeepSeek-R1-0528/DeepSeek-R1-0528-THIREUS-ANY-SPECIAL.sh#L482-L486)). Run `llama-quantize --help` to list compatible quants for `quant_assign.py`. This approach is especially useful if you prefer `llama.cpp` over `ik_llama.cpp`.

## üì¶ What‚Äôs in this repository?

- **00001 GGUF header shard** ‚Äì Contains metadata (tokens, chat template, tensor count, etc.). This metadata can be explored directly from the HuggingFace web interface after clicking on that shard.  
- **Tensor shards** ‚Äì Each shard holds one tensor; see `tensors.map` for names, quant types, sizes, SHA-256 hash, shard IDs, etc.  
- **GPG-signed files** ‚Äì `tensors.map` and header shard are signed with the key in [trusted-keys.asc](https://github.com/Thireus/GGUF-Tool-Suite/blob/main/trusted-keys.asc) for tamper detection.  
- **Security note** ‚Äì Some papers about various ways to attack GGUFs and LLMs are available online, such as https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23786, and there are also more classic security exploits like CVE-2024-23496 and CVE-2024-25664 through CVE-2024-25668. Only use GGUFs from reputable, trusted authors‚Äîor alternatively self-quantize‚Äîto avoid potential exploits.

## üí° Pro Tips

You can easily download the BF16 model version to quantize your own shards:

```
mkdir kitchen  
echo '.*=bf16' > kitchen/bf16.recipe  
cd kitchen
../quant_downloader.sh bf16.recipe  
```

Enjoy optimized quantization! üéâ
